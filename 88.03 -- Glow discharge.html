    <p>An induction coil, whose primary operates at six volts, provides 
pulsating high voltage across the ends of a discharge tube, at each end 
of which is a circular plate having a diameter roughly equal to the i.d.
 of the tube. The distance between the electrodes is about <span class="nowrap">71.5 cm,</span> and the tube i.d. is about <span class="nowrap">4.5 cm.</span> You can evacuate the tube by connecting a vacuum pump to the side arm in the center of the tube.</p>
  </blockquote>

    <p>With the tube at atmospheric pressure, when you turn on the 
induction coil, its output voltage is not high enough to achieve 
breakdown. When you turn the pump on and begin evacuating the tube, when
 the pressure gets to several tens of torr, you see thin, intense 
ribbons spanning the space between the electrodes. These then coalesce 
into a broader, single ribbon. Then, the entire space between the 
electrodes lights up. Eventually, striations appear in the middle 
section. If you pump for several minutes, the middle third, or so, of 
the tube darkens relative to the ends. The glowing gas that fills the 
tube is a plasma, which you can deflect in various ways with the magnet 
shown in the photograph. </p>
    <p>This demonstration shows a type of electrical discharge through a gas, called <em>glow discharge</em>.

 -- Inductor spark yield impressive arcs, as well.) As opposed to an 
arc, a glow discharge has a structure; it has bright and dark areas in 
specific places, as the text below describes.</p>
    <p>Glow discharge is the formation of a plasma by the electrical 
breakdown of a gas.  Normally, gases are insulators. Because of cosmic 
rays or other natural background radiation, a volume of gas contains a 
few randomly generated electrons. When you place a high voltage across 
two electrodes in the gas, these electrons are accelerated in the 
electric field between the electrodes. If the mean free path of the 
electrons is long enough that over that distance they acquire enough 
energy to ionize a gas molecule, this releases more electrons, which 
then ionize more gas molecules. The ions thus formed can also eject 
electrons when they collide with the negative electrode (the cathode). 
The various collisions among electrons, ions and neutral gas molecules 
result in breakdown, and a current is sustained between the cathode and 
the anode of the discharge tube. The plasma thus formed is an 
electrically neutral mixture of electrons, positive ions and 
electronically excited neutral gas molecules. It is the emission of 
excited molecules relaxing to lower energy states that we see as the 
glow.</p>
    <p>As the above would indicate, there is a relationship among the 
gas pressure, distance between the electrodes, and the minimum voltage 
at which breakdown occurs. The breakdown voltage, <em>V</em><span class="style1"><sub>s</sub></span> (for “spark voltage”), is a function of <em>p</em>, the pressure, and <em>d</em>,
 the distance between the electrodes. The exact shape of this function 
varies somewhat according to the particular gas, but its main features 
remain the same. It has a minimum that ranges from about one to a few 
hundred volts, at a <em>pd</em> on the order of one <span class="nowrap">torr-cm.</span> To either side of this minimum, <em>V</em><span class="style1"><sub>s</sub></span>
 rises. This curve reflects the perhaps surprising behavior that, for a 
given pressure, and for some applied voltage above the minimum, there is
 a range of electrode distances over which breakdown occurs, but if one 
moves the electrodes either too far apart or too close together, the 
voltage is insufficient to cause breakdown. Essentially, this is because
 when the electrodes are too close together, the electron mean free path
 is too long relative to the gap, and not enough collisions occur to 
cause breakdown. When the electrodes are too far apart, however, the gap
 is too much longer than the electron mean free path, and electrons 
suffer so many collisions that they never arrive at the anode. The law 
stating the relationship among <em>V</em><span class="style1"><sub>s</sub></span>, <em>p</em> and <em>d</em> is called <em>Paschen’s law</em>, and the curve is called a <em>Paschen curve</em>, after Friedrich Paschen, who developed them from observations he made of discharges in various gases.</p>
    <p>The nature of the discharge, for a given gas composition, depends
 on the pressure, the voltage across the electrodes and the current 
through the plasma. In this demonstration, the current is not 
controlled, and you vary the pressure by pumping through the side arm of
 the tube. (A clamp or valve could be added to make it possible to hold 
the pressure at a particular value.) For a tube this size, at 
atmospheric pressure, it would require probably about 
	1,400 to <span class="nowrap">2,000 kilovolts</span> (or between about 1.4 and <span class="nowrap">2 million volts)</span>
 to achieve breakdown, and the resulting arc would be similar to those 
one sees with a Van de Graaff generator. Since the induction coil 
produces a potential of several kilovolts, or perhaps several tens of 
kilovolts, we cannot observe this type of breakdown in this 
demonstration.</p>
    <p>As you start pumping the air out of the tube, at some point, 
probably 
	several tens of torr, you see a broad, ribbon-like discharge along the 
length of the tube. (This starts out as several thin streamers when 
breakdown first occurs.) When the pressure gets to a few torr, the 
discharge forms various light and dark regions. Starting from the 
cathode, a typical glow discharge exhibits a thin, glowing region near 
the cathode, separated from it by a thin dark layer called the <em>Aston dark space</em>. The thin glowing region is called the <em>cathode glow</em>. On the other side of the cathode glow is a wider dark space, called the <em>cathode dark space</em>, or <em>Crookes</em> or <em> Hittorf</em> <em>dark space</em>. Next is a glowing region called the <em>negative glow</em>, followed by another dark space called the <em>Faraday dark space</em>. After the Faraday dark space is a long glowing region called the <em>positive column</em>,
 which fills most of the distance between the electrodes. Sometimes, the
 anode end of the positive column is brighter than the rest; this is 
called the <em>anode glow</em>. This end of the positive column is separated from the anode by a dark region called the <em>anode dark space</em>.
 Usually, for a given pressure and applied voltage, the dimensions of 
the various regions of the glow discharge are fairly well defined, with 
the positive column varying according to the distance between the 
electrodes. In this demonstration, many of the features listed above may
 not be easily visible, and you will see striations in the positive 
column.</p>
    <p>If you continue pumping, at some point the discharge weakens, and, if you get the presure low enough, probably below about <span class="nowrap">1 millitorr,</span>
 it goes out. In this demonstration, you can get the pressure low enough
 to darken roughly the middle third of the tube. If you could get the 
pressure low enough, you would again need several hundred kilovolts to 
cause breakdown, and in this case, you would observe little or no glow 
between the electrodes, but the glass would emit a greenish 
fluorescence. This fluorescence is due to collisions of high-speed 
electrons generated at the cathode, or <em>cathode rays</em>. In a tube 
with perforated electrodes (the ones in this demonstration are solid), 
under these conditions you can see dots behind each electrode. Behind 
the anode, these are from cathode rays. Behind the cathode, they are 
from collisions with the glass of ions that have crossed the tube from 
the anode, or <em>anode rays</em>.</p>
    <p>As noted above, the plasma that makes up the discharge (or at 
least the parts where the glow is strongest) is an electrically neutral 
mixture of electrons, ions and excited neutral molecules (or, in a 
monatomic gas, atoms). The electrons flow from the cathode to the anode,
 and the ions move in the opposite direction. When you hold the magnet 
shown in the photograph near the side of the tube, then, this gives rise
 to a <span class="nowrap"><em>qv</em> × <strong>B</strong>,</span> and 
electrons and ions suffer a sideways force. Because both types of 
particles are traveling in opposite directions, but also have opposite 
sign, they are deflected together. So when you bring the magnet near the
 tube, the plasma bends around the area where you hold the pole of the 
magnet, and you can move the bend around as you change the orientation 
of the magnet.</p>
